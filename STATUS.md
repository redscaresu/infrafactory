## Current phase

- 🚧 **Active arc**: `docs/plans/presentable-arc-plan.md` (S144–S150) — making infrafactory demonstrable on stage for the *"Letting Agents Change Production Without Breaking It"* talk, 2–6 weeks out. Scoped by what the talk must be able to **show**. The spine is S144, a label-triggered PR gate that applies to real Scaleway, destroys, sweeps, and comments the stage summary back — which is what turns "before it ever reaches a production repo" from aspiration into an artifact. S145 builds the evidence that `plan` passes where the real cloud refuses; S150 closes the CI-hardening delta found against `redscaresu/goldfinger` (govulncheck, explicit `permissions:` blocks, SHA-pinned actions).

- 🎯 **Baseline: 44/44 deterministic** + **fakegenesys v0.2.1** + **27 paired contracts across the family** (CI-enforced via `handlers/contract_audit_test.go` in all 4 siblings) + **ADR-0021 cloud-prefix lockstep CI-enforced**.
- ✅ **Last arc complete**: `docs/plans/layer3-real-scaleway-plan.md` (S139–S143) — **Layer 3 now applies to and destroys real Scaleway infrastructure.** Code-complete since S30, it had never called `api.scaleway.com`; it does now. Both canary runs are green end-to-end (`preflight → init → plan → apply → destroy → orphan_sweep`), run 1 with seeded HCL to isolate the harness and run 2 with the **LLM generating the HCL** — `target_reached` in one iteration. Sweeps clean and independently confirmed against the account; it ends in the same state it started. Guardrails: sealed sandbox env + fail-closed endpoint assertion, mockway `account/v3` projects with non-empty-delete, real-API orphan sweep with a state-derived stray check, `AssertProjectDeletable`, interrupt-safe destroy + `infrafactory reap`, a disposable fallback project, and a deny-by-default resource-type allowlist — each with synthetic-drift coverage.

The canary found three defects nothing else could. Run 1: the orphan sweep read `terraform-live.tfstate` *after* destroy emptied it, and mockway's seeded default project counted as a Layer 2 orphan — which would have failed `no_orphans` for **every scenario in the suite** (both fixed in S143a). Run 2: real Scaleway returned a block-volume create error *after* the volume existed, leaving it tainted; transient, and a re-apply succeeded. Diagnosing it was hard because Layer 3 reported only `exit status 1` — both sandbox paths discarded the provider's message. Fixed via the shared `stderrFailureDetail` helper; ADR-0023 amended (fail-closed is necessary but not sufficient).

Deltas in `docs/layer3-real-vs-mock-deltas.md`. Close-out in `docs/status/ARCHIVE.md`.

**Layer 3 follow-ups now closed** (post-arc). A failed run no longer just destroys and hopes: it captures the sweep target before destroy and sweeps afterwards, and any failure raised while real resources may still exist carries `infrafactory reap <scenario>` in its detail, where the operator actually reads it. Apply also retries once — bounded, surfaced as `succeeded on attempt 2`, and never on a cancelled context, so the interrupt guard still holds.

Codex review loop now runs on every PR (2 consecutive clean passes to converge; passes recorded in `docs/review-passes/`). Pass 1 on the arc caught one real defect: the `infrafactory reap` recovery hint was not shell-quoted, so a scenario path containing a space produced a command that would not run.

**Dependency pipeline unblocked** (2026-08-23). Doc Hygiene required a `STATUS.md` edit for any `go.mod`/`go.sum` change — which dependabot cannot make — so with required status checks on `main`, **every Go dependency PR was permanently unmergeable**; eight had piled up, the oldest three weeks old. Dependency-manifest-only changes are now exempt, all-or-nothing: a PR that bumps `go.mod` *and* touches `internal/` still needs `STATUS.md`. `scripts/check_doc_hygiene_test.sh` pins both halves and runs in CI.

**Probe canary run (2026-08-23)**: `lb-paris` gained a `connectivity` criterion and ran against real Scaleway. The real-probe path works — it resolved the LB's public IP from `terraform-live.tfstate` and opened a TCP connection to it, the first time that code has run against anything but a mock. It also found a **real leak**: `test` only cleaned up after a *successful* sandbox apply, so a partial apply (killed by an IAM permission error) left a real project and LB IP billing until reaped by hand. Fixed — cleanup is now gated on the sandbox layer having run, not having worked. Deltas in `docs/layer3-real-vs-mock-deltas.md` (D4).

**Superseded next-arc opener**: `lb-paris` as probe canary — but note it currently declares **no probes** (only `region_restriction` + `no_orphans`), so the arc needs probe criteria added to the scenario first; it is not just a run. The five scenarios that do declare probes (`compute-lb-multi-paris`, `mysql-ha-paris`, `redis-xlarge-session-paris`, `web-app-paris`, `gcp-cloud-sql`) are all substantially more expensive. Costs real money either way, so scope it deliberately.

## OSS-readiness

All four repos (`infrafactory`, `mockway`, `fakegcp`, `fakeaws`) ship Apache-2.0 + SECURITY.md + CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md + CONTRIBUTING.md + CHANGELOG.md + release workflow. Pre-commit hook (`gitleaks` + `go test`) installable via `make install-hooks`. Full-history `gitleaks detect` zero leaks.

**User-only click-ops pending** (private → public visibility flip + branch protection on each repo).

## Known blockers

None.

## Open tickets

None — `docs/tickets/rename-learning-system.md` closed by S104.

## Update policy

- Trim this file every arc close-out — historical detail belongs in `docs/status/ARCHIVE.md`.
- Goal: ≤ 30 lines. If it grows past 50, time to trim again.
- ADRs and `CONCEPT.md` carry durable architecture decisions; STATUS.md is just the current-shape pointer.
