# STATUS

Last updated: 2026-06-02

## Current phase

- **GCP phase2 prompt-collapse complete.** Nine retirements landed between S56 (firewall) and S73 (project_service + project_iam_member). Phase2 prompt now contains only rules 1–8 (system contract) + 16 (region) + 17 (naming) — the destination described in `slices-54-62-plan.md` § "Big picture". The N10→N11→N13 auto-derivation pipeline is end-to-end and battle-tested across two sustain-ratchet sweeps (S63, ~implicit via S72/S73 runs).
- **Next arc planned**: `docs/plans/slices-74-78-plan.md` — apply the collapse pattern to AWS + Scaleway prompts, run a post-collapse sweep, drain 2–3 `docs/mock-gaps.md` entries, land `make sweep-39` + N3 classifier escape carve-out. ~8–12 hr.
- Older arc close-outs (S54–S73) and milestones (S1–S53) live in `docs/status/ARCHIVE.md`.

## In progress

- No active implementation tickets. S63–S67 arc planned but not started — see `docs/plans/slices-63-67-plan.md`.

## OSS-readiness (2026-05-23)

All four repos (`infrafactory`, `mockway`, `fakegcp`, `fakeaws`) ship: Apache-2.0 LICENSE, SECURITY.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md, .editorconfig, .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ + pull_request_template.md, release workflow. Pre-commit hook (`gitleaks` + `go test`) installable via `make install-hooks` on every repo. Full-history `gitleaks detect` returned zero leaks.

**Click-ops still pending (user-only):**
- `gh repo edit --visibility public` on each repo when ready.
- Branch protection rules on `main` (free-tier blocks on private; works post-flip).

## Known blockers

- None.

## Next actions

1. Run the S63–S67 arc per `docs/plans/slices-63-67-plan.md`.
2. Keep `go test -tags noui ./...` + `bash scripts/check_all.sh` green.

## Update policy

- Update at end of each meaningful coding session.
- Keep entries concise.
- Move old detail to `docs/status/ARCHIVE.md`.
- Put durable architecture decisions in ADRs and `CONCEPT.md`.
- Keep startup/read-order in `SESSION_START.md` to avoid duplication.

## Recent updates

See `docs/status/ARCHIVE.md` § "2026-06-02 S54–S62 close-out" for the per-slice narrative. Older recent-updates content (S33–S53 close-outs, the auto-learning loop design notes, the 2026-05-30 → 2026-05-31 sweep narratives) is in the same file.
